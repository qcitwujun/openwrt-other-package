; Asterisk Builtin mini-HTTP server
;
;
; Note about Asterisk documentation:
;   If Asterisk was installed from a tarball, then the HTML documentation should
;   be installed in the static-http/docs directory which is
;   (/var/lib/asterisk/static-http/docs) on linux by default.  If the Asterisk
;   HTTP server is enabled in this file by setting the "enabled", "bindaddr",
;   and "bindport" options, then you should be able to view the documentation
;   remotely by browsing to:
;       http://<server_ip>:<bindport>/static/docs/index.html
;
[general]
;
; The name of the server, advertised in both the Server field in HTTP
; response message headers, as well as the <address /> element in certain HTTP
; response message bodies. If not furnished here, "Asterisk/{version}" will be
; used as a default value for the Server header field and the <address />
; element. Setting this property to a blank value will result in the omission
; of the Server header field from HTTP response message headers and the
; <address /> element from HTTP response message bodies.
